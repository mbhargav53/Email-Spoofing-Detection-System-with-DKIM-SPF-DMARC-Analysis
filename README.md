## üìù Description

This section provides a detailed overview of the project.

The **Email Spoofing Detection System** is a **security analysis tool** designed to **validate incoming email headers against established authentication protocols (DMARC, DKIM, and SPF) to accurately identify and flag phishing or spoofed emails before they reach the user's inbox.**

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Comprehensive Header Analysis:** Parses email headers to extract `Return-Path`, `Received-SPF`, `DKIM-Signature`, and `Authentication-Results`.
* **Protocol Validation Engine:** Implements logic to check the alignment and pass/fail status of **DMARC**, **DKIM**, and **SPF** records for the sending domain.
* **Real-time Spoofing Score:** Assigns a risk score to each email based on authentication failures, providing a quantifiable measure of suspicion.
* **Reporting & Logging:** Generates detailed logs of validation attempts and flags emails for quarantine or immediate deletion based on configuration.

### üõ† Technology Stack

* **Core Logic:** Python (using libraries like `email` for parsing and `dnspython` for DNS lookups).
* **Framework (Optional):** Flask for building a lightweight web-based reporting interface.
* **Database:** SQLite for storing historical analysis data.
